# INSTANT-MESSAGE-NETWORK-REPRESENTATION
Implemented in C language using a partially persistent graph(built from scratch). A new edge between two users is generated(or broken) when a new conversation starts(or ends), without generating new graphs and still preserving the old version of the graph.Was able to pull out the chatting pattern of users with time.
